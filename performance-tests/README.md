A little script for testing performance of various video characteristics (length, encoding, etc)

HOW TO USE THE PERFORMANCE TEST SCRIPT
--------------------------------------

Create new folder and place videos inside.

"./perf_test.sh [path to folder] [output file name]"

The script will input all the videos in "path to folder" into the SDK and the performance times are written to "output file name".
